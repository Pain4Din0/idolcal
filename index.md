# Welcome to idolcal

The idolcal project is intended to collect the birthday data of characters and seiyuus of a number of idol projects. You can download the `.ics` file down below and import it to your calendar to trace and set reminders for your favorite anime character or seiyuu.

Download & subscribe links are on the bottom of this site.

### Projects we have supported now

- LoveLive Series (including μ's, Aqours, Nijigasaki High School Idol Club and Liella)
- BanG Dream Project (all 7 bands)
- 22/7 Project
- IDOLY PRIDE

### Tips of the calendar time zone

Time zones of all the calendars here are set to `Asia/Tokyo` (GMT+9), which means  you can get the right reminder notification without change the time zone of your own calendar.

> eg. My current time zone is `Asia/Shanghai` (GMT+8, an hour later than Tokyo time), so I will receive birthday notification of [鐘 嵐珠](https://lovelive-as.bushimo.jp/member/lanzhu/) (Feb 15) at 23:00, Feb 14.
